# Final Presentation Project: Synthesizing Design Insights

## Submission Details:

- **Submission date**: 04.12.2024, 17:59 CET
- **Submission materials**: A presentation file (your preferred format) named using the group member's last names, e.g., `einstein_curie.pdf`. Upload link
- **Presentation date**: 04.12.2024 in class

## Project Description
In this final presentation, you will synthesize the insights gained from the three exercises conducted throughout the course, focusing on evidence-based design for healthcare, spatial analysis, and user behavior in architectural spaces. The aim is to create a cohesive narrative that demonstrates how the knowledge acquired in each exercise informs and enhances the others.

## Objective
The final presentation should showcase the integration of concepts from all three exercises, providing a holistic perspective on how evidence-based analysis, spatial intervention, and user experience considerations contribute to designing effective healthcare environments. You are expected to demonstrate their ability to critically connect theoretical frameworks, spatial design strategies, and empirical evidence in a unified manner.

## Presentation Requirements:
- **Groups:** The groups will remain the same as in exercise 3.
- **Presentation Format:** 10-minute presentation with approx. 5-minute Q&A.
- **Focus Areas:** Include elements from each of the three exercises:
    - **Evidence-Based Design Principles:** Summarize your group's findings from Exercise 1. Highlight the key design takeaways from the research paper, and how they inform healthcare design strategies.
    - **Spatial Intervention:** Present the intervention designed in Exercise 2, including before and after visualizations. Explain how the interventions aimed to improve key metrics such as the Spaces for Communication Index (SCI) and the Yale Traffic Index (YTI).
    - **User Experience Evaluation:** Share the findings from Exercise 3, where the user behavior was analyzed in a 3D virtual walkthrough of the intervention. Highlight how the changes impacted wayfinding, movement efficiency, or other aspects of user experience.

## Evaluation Criteria
The final project will be evaluated on:
- **Integration and Synthesis (40%):** How effectively the three exercises are connected to provide a comprehensive design strategy.
- **Design and Intervention Quality (30%):** Quality of the proposed design intervention and the depth of its analysis.
- **Critical reflection on the gains and risks associated with evidence-based design (20%):** A fter being exposed to a few evidence- and tool-based approaches to designing buildings, we are interested on your reflection on the risks and usefulness of these tools.
- **Clarity and Presentation Skills (10%):** Clarity of communication, slide design, and engagement during the presentation.

You are encouraged to be creative and use visual storytelling techniques to effectively communicate their design journey and insights. The final presentation should not only highlight what was learned but also reflect on how the exercises collectively deepen the understanding of healthcare environment design. If you conduct additional analysis using the course tools or external tools to make your project more coherent or introduce additional aspects, this will be taken into account in the grading.
